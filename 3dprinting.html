        <h1>Matter Hackers COVID Response</h1>
        <h3>3D Printing PPE for frontline workers</h3>
        <p>At the time COVID hit the US, I was looking for new efforts to pursue that wouldn't be interreupted during a lockdock.
            I was luck enough to stumble upon some 3D printing blogs and fall down that rabbit-hole a few months before any serious
             supply chain issues. Fall 2019, in my 1 bedroom Philadelphia apartment, I built my first 
             <a href = "https://www.prusa3d.com/">Prusa MK3S Printer.</a> 
        </p>

            A few months into the venture, COVID cases were spiking and hospitals were over-run with patients while front-line workers were suffering
             from a lack of resources and PPE. My center city apartment building was home to dozens of nurses and doctors in the Philadelphia area and 
            I heard about the struggle on a daily basis. Through the <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/covid-19">Matter Hackers</a> community 
            I learned that maker communities were coming together to help get printed PPE into the hands of front-line workers. So, I downloaded some 
            designs and fired up my printer to see what I could do.

            Designed to go behind the head and allow for adjustable surgical mask attachment to prevent ear pain and discomfort.</p>

            The face shield has a sheet of clear laminating paper attached to the hood and is worn on ones head to act as a solid barrier over the face and prevent direct exposure with sick patients.</p>

            <p>First Delivery: 13 Face shields & 20 Surgical mask comfort straps<img src="./assets/images/print/image6.JPG"> I was able to pack them up and deliver them to hospital workers in my building to 
                get them in use immediately.
            </p>
            <p>There was also a design for a printable N95 mask circulating but after the first print I could tell the design needed some work and was not front-line ready.
                It required custom molding to the wearers face, and an additional filter which I had no way of procuring at the time.

            I learned a lot from this endevour. It was a fantastic way to get deep into the 3D printing industry very quickly. I was able to develop a more complete understanding of this printer types limitations within the scope of manufacturing. 
            Not long after, papers were published regarding the use of 3D printed PPE for the COVID-19 response and much of my own learnings were corroberated. It gave me a tremendous sense of pride to know I was able to help out my neighbors while 
            being trapped inside during quarantine.
