        <h1>Matter Hackers COVID Response</h1>
        <h2>3D Printing PPE for frontline workers</h2>
        <p>At the time COVID hit the US, I was looking for new efforts to pursue that wouldn't be interreupted during a lockdock.
            I was luck enough to stumble upon some 3D printing blogs and fall down that rabbit-hole a few months before any serious
             supply chain issues. Fall 2019, in my 1 bedroom Philadelphia apartment, I built my first 
             <a href = "https://www.prusa3d.com/">Prusa MK3S Printer.</a> 
        </p>
        <p>
            I quickly connected with several Maker communities and twitter accounts to boost my self-learning with some tips and tricks.
             This type of endevour does not need to be suffered through when there is a wealth of information already in existance to 
             boost productivity. We were off and running, printing anything that caught my eye. I was even utilizing the 3D printer for 
             rapid prototyping with a small jewelry business I was starting at the time. This cut my R&D costs significantly and allowed
              me to print dozens of prospective products in near real-time. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A few months into the venture COVID was peaking, hospitals were over-run with patients and front-line workers were suffering.
            I happened to live in an apartment building in Center City Philadelphia with several medical schools in the area and many of 
            my neighbors in resident programs or working in hospitals and I could saw the struggle daily.</p>
        <p>    
            Several maker communities started sharing designs for face shields and N-95 mask filters and I immediately answered the call 
            for help. After a few calibration prints, I had my single MK3S up and running printing faceshields around the clock. I was 
            able to get these shields printed and distributed to local hospitals on a daily basis.

    <p> What was learned during the project </p>

        <p>Supply chain issues are not easily predictable</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nozzle cleanliness is key to consistent prints</li>
            <li>Keeping the print bed clean and using a glue stick can increase first layer print quality</li>
            <li>Lubing the shaft is incredibly important to ensure a smooth print experience</li>
        </ul>
