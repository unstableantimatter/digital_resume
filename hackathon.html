        <h1>Technical Services Hackathon</h1>
        <h2>Utilizing Merkle-tree hash structures for continuous infrastructure monitoring and achieving CIS compliance</h2>
        <p>
            I joined SEI Investments in 2015, right after finishing my masters program. I was hired into the Graduates 
            Rotational Program working on the Global Wealth Platform, which was intended to allow new hires the 
            opportunity to float about he department and land in a group that attracted their interests. As I possessed a 
            penchant for cybersecurity and systems management I naturally gravitated towards the technical services group. 
            Out of the 20 new hires that were brought on to the GWP before me, I was the only one to end up in tech. services.
            It was soon after joining the team that I found out the probable causes of this phenomena.
        </p>
        <p>
            The GWP was striving for CIS compliance which required a number of drastic changes around the department.
            Some of those being enhancing account management procedures, enforcing stricter physical access controls, 
            and a little something called system hardening and continuous system vulnerability management. It turns out, when 
            I was being interviewed I had mentioned that I was familiar with <a href = "https://www.openvas.org/">OpenVAS</a> 
            (Opensource Nessus), and several managers had kept that fact in mind. Needless to say, they were pleased to welcome me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Back to the story; close to the end of the year, development cycles tend to slow down with folks taking time off and 
            the holidays. So the GWP department hosts a hackathon across all of the different release trains to attempt a year end 
            productivity milking from their salaried employees with the promise of $25 Wawa gift cards. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For me it wasn't about a gift card, this was my chance to show off my understanding of cryptography in a practical, 
            home-made, application that could save the department oodles and achieve the highly sought after "Continuous Monitoring"
             checkmark for the CIS compliance audit. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The big idea here was to create an automated process to track configuration drift in the OpenVAS reports generated from 
            infrastructure scans. These reports are output as CSVs so with a little cleaning and definition I was convinced there was 
            a simple solution not far from my reach.
        </p>
        <p>
            I worked with the tech. services team, who was responsible for performing cost benefit analysis on various tech solutions 
            that would be utilized across the dev. department. We looked at nearly a dozen paid services to accomplish what I had sought 
            out to cover with this homegrown hack. I cannot recall exact costs of these other solutions but due to the quick rejection of 
            these services from upper management, I feel confident saying that any paid service would have cost us a pretty penny to license 
            and maintain. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, when I accepted the $25 Wawa gift card award I also signed off on the rights to the code that I had put together. 
            Perhaps in the future I will put together a v2 that covers more compliance standards and works much better.
